# TodoMVC frontend using React

This project serves as a hands-on for React, as well as a training ground. 
It is also a showcase for functional components, hooks and testing.
It was made based on the public project TodoMVC.

TodoMVC is a project that aims to offer developers a way to compare the different frameworks. In order to do so, the 
very same application is made using each of the framework, making it easier to compare them.
